It would be helpful if there are more than 1 sample testcase is provided to verify the code. Or atleast the test case is not the basic one. It doesn't make sense when the sample test case pass but all the other fails. The sample can be passed even by hard coding the values. If the problem statement is not easy to understand, atleast the sample testcase should help to simplify the problem
